This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.


## Features:

1. **Dashboard**:
   - Display a list of trending movies using the TMDB API.
   - A search mechanism to find movies by title.

2. **Movie Details**:
   - Show detailed information about a movie, including its description, release date, and genres.


### Technologies Used:
- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.
- **TMDB API**: To fetch movie data and user-related information (e.g., ratings, watchlist).
- **Context/Redux**: For global state management to handle user data, movie information, and ratings.

### Notes:
- Due to time constraints, the login screen and the add-to-cart functionality were omitted from the project.
- The app adheres to **UI/UX best practices**, focusing on a simple, intuitive interface for an optimal user experience.

### Future Improvements:
- Add login screen for user authentication.
- Implement an add-to-cart feature for purchasing tickets or merchandise.
- Improve error handling and loading states for a better user experience.
- Add unit and integration tests for key components.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
